In this small project I will load in DICOM medical images as well as associated, target contour data. The purpose is to set up the infrastructure on which I can run and train a convolutional neural network model to learn DICOM features and later classify and/or predict information from the contour files. 

Everything can be found in the Jupyter notebook - it is quite self explanatory, using the data found in final_data and a few functions from parsing.py.
